## Region support

- We have tested installing the Accelerator in multiple different primary regions, but have not done a formal region support assessment
- As most features can be toggled on/off (per region), we expect most regions should be supportable as a primary (or installation) region, and when not, it should be supported as a managed (or secondary) region
- The Accelerator cannot be _installed_ directly in the following regions due to a lack of Stack Set support: Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Osaka), China (Beijing), China (Ningxia), Europe (Milan), Middle East (Bahrain)
- We also expect to have issues _installing_ into regions which do not have Firewall Manager support, as we did not include the capability to disabled setting the admin account
- These regions are likely supported as managed but non-primary regions, the initial install simply must be in a fully supported region
- If sufficient demand exists, we may investigate resolving these blockers (Stack sets are only used for one trivial item today)
