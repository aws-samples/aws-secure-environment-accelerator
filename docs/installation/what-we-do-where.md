## ToDo: Add to above table (supported today)

- Populate Parameter Store with user objects, plus ELB's in perimeter store
- Deploy and share SSM documents
- Deploy Config rules
- Setup SNS Alerting topics
- Deploy CloudWatch Log Metrics and Alarms

## Region support

- Lack of availability of CodeBuild, CodeCommit, or AWS Organizations in the Accelerator primary or installation region will prevent installation directly in that region. Customers can select a different installation region and the Accelerator can remotely deploy configurations and guardrails to that unsupported installation region.
- Prior to v1.2.5, we utilized a single StackSet, which blocked several additional installation regions. The Accelerator no longer leverages any StackSets, unblocking installing directly in several additional regions.
- As most features can be toggled on/off (per region), we expect most regions should be supportable as a primary (or installation) region, and when not, it should be supported as a managed (or secondary) region.
