# Preparation

The preparation steps can be done in advance, can be run multiple times and will not modify your current environment. We encourage customers to start the preparation as soon as possible, even if not planning to apply the upgrade immediately.

The preparations steps are

- Preparation:
    1. [Pre-requisites and configuration](./prereq-config.md)
    2. [Resource mapping and drift detection](./resource-mapping-drift-detection.md)
    3. [Handling drift from Resource mapping](./drift-handling.md)
    4. [Configuration conversion](./configuration-conversion.md)
    5. [Pre-upgrade validations](./validation.md)

!!! tip "Optional inventory step"
    There is an optional read-only [inventory script](./inventory.md) that you can run as part of your early preparation to to help identify features or configurations that require extra planning or considerations.
