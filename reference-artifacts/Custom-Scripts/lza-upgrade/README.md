This folder contains all the tools and scripts to perform an in-place upgrade from ASEA to Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA).

The full documentation for ASEA to LZA upgrade is now available in the [AWS Secure Environment Accelerator documentation guide on GitHub pages](https://aws-samples.github.io/aws-secure-environment-accelerator/latest/lza-upgrade)

**Release v1.6.0 of ASEA is the first release of ASEA that includes the tooling to support an in-place upgrade of ASEA to LZA. There are no functional changes to ASEA between version v1.5.11 and v1.6.0 other than those needed to support the upgrade.**

> **⚠️ Warning**: You should not upgrade to v1.6.0 prior to starting the upgrade, you need to be at v1.5.11 before starting the upgrade.
