Note:
firewall-example-A-A-multitunnel.txt
- this configuration brings up the second tunnel on each firewall instance
- we also worked with the vendor to refine this sample configuration

firewall-example-A-A-discontinued.txt
- customer wanting to continue to deploy single tunnel can leverage this sample
- this is similiar to the previous config but includes the refinements we made to the multitunnel config
